I want to create a website
I don't have a preferred tech stack. Here are the goals of the website:

- Allows users to add note or quotes to a db/list.
- Quotes are shown randomly each page refresh. The text is clear and legible. It should not take up the whole page, it should be centred, and it should not be too small.
- Quotes can also be viewed via a "view all" button.
- Quotes can also be tagged.
- Minimal and clean design
- The page data should be stored locally on the browser for now, but we'll improve it to store in firebase later.

--------------------------------------------

For this prompt, pretend you're a product manager and product designer. What should be the first page users see? How do we explain the value proposition and get them to use the website, but ideally they sign up first. If the main page requires pictures, describe them to me. If we need different fonts or colours, tell me about that too.


---------------------------------------------

I want to emulate the landing page screenshots by using some dummy data, and perspective effect. The simulated images would correspond to what you had designed previously. This way when the design of the website changes, the "images" are also updated.
Can you explain how you'd go about building this?
